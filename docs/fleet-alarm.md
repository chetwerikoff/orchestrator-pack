# Coordinator fleet alarm

Fleet sweep/wake is a per-project operator notifier. A selected agent pane
whose **last non-empty content line** is `PARKED on <X>` is `PARKED`.
Task binding, a separate `wait` object, a producer receipt, invocation index,
owner/generation assertion or PID identity is **not** required. The last line
wins over earlier scrollback and the regular busy/STOPPED classification.

A parked dependency is a plain event-name match: `X` is matched against the
eligible terminal-envelope filename or invocation ID, a finished pack-review
run, or a finished CI result. A match sends one ordinary `Wake: ... re-check`
message to **that parked pane**, not an instruction to resume or resend a
Browser-GPT turn. The only Wake safety exclusion is a pane detected as
`suspected_bare_shell`: the notifier must never type Wake text into that
shell (it could execute the line as a command). It sends one coordinator
alarm identifying the pane instead. No other ownership, receipt, launcher,
Task, process, generation or claimant proof is required. No receipt/locator
index is maintained in the fleet notifier.

Each successful named Wake records one simple `(pane,event)` sent marker.
A repeat tick does not resend the same event to the same pane; a different
pane parked on the same event can be woken independently. A changed event
can generate another Wake. The normal 30-minute parked Reminder remains
available for unresolved dependencies; a PARKED pane does **not** raise
an immediate coordinator alarm for missing or unresolvable producer evidence.

Coordinator alarms are keyed by **individual pane state**, not the hash of
the entire stopped-pane set. A pane becoming STOPPED or POLLING raises one
alarm for that change; an unchanged pane is not re-alarmed merely because
another pane changes between busy, PARKED and STOPPED. PARKED is silent
until its existing 30-minute Reminder. Bare-shell suspicion produces one
coordinator alarm per pane/state change. ChatGPT banner and Run-mail
notifications use their existing separate routing and marks.

The notifier itself makes no GitHub, Task/Dispatch, scheduler or supervisor
mutation and grants no authority to automatically continue, merge, retry or
send a Browser-GPT prompt. The #2484 PERMISSION classification is separate
from this park/wake policy and is not changed.

## One-off sweep

Run from the pack checkout with the Node major declared in `scripts/toolchain/node-version.json`:

```bash
node --experimental-strip-types scripts/lib/Invoke-TypeScriptCli.ts \
  --repo-root "$PWD" --script "$PWD/scripts/fleet/fleet-sweep.ts" -- \
  --project my-project
```

The selected project card supplies the primary checkout and matching rules. Use
`--json` for machine-readable output and `--lines <n>` to change the displayed
tail. The sweep itself makes no Orca mutation.

## Install one project instance

Choose a short systemd instance name such as `my-project`. Do not run the old
machine-local reference fleet alarm and the pack service for the same project at
the same time.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/orchestrator-fleet ~/.config/systemd/user ~/.local/state/orchestrator-fleet
cp scripts/fleet/fleet-wake@.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
cp scripts/fleet/fleet-wake.env.example ~/.config/orchestrator-fleet/my-project.env
$EDITOR ~/.config/orchestrator-fleet/my-project.env
systemctl --user edit fleet-wake@my-project # per-instance drop-in shown below
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now fleet-wake@my-project
```

Set `PRIMARY` to the absolute primary checkout path. Optional keys are
`WORKSPACE_RE`, `ORCH_TITLE_RE` (default `Cursor`), `ORCH_HANDLE`,
`ARCHITECT_HANDLE`, `BUSY_RE`, and `FLEET_WAKE_INTERVAL` (default `300` seconds).
The selected project card remains the checkout/matching authority. Render the
service's `{PACK_ROOT}` placeholders with the trusted pack path before installing
it; logs append to `~/.local/state/orchestrator-fleet/my-project.fleet-wake.log`.

`ARCHITECT_HANDLE` optionally excludes one exact Orca terminal handle from fleet
units. Both fleet-wake and the one-off sweep consume this environment key; export
it for the one-off command as well. The excluded pane is not screen-read or
classified, named as a unit in fleet alarms, or directly woken for GPT/CI events
or chat banners. No title or pattern identifies an architect: another pane with
the same title remains eligible. Leaving the key unset preserves normal behavior
and coordinator selection. An explicit chat binding to the excluded handle also
stops ownership lookup; it cannot fall through to another worker.

### Operator-owned environment ingress and activation

The tracked unit does not load a local env file. Editing that file and restarting
alone does not supply `ARCHITECT_HANDLE`. The operator must ensure that the selected
instance has a per-instance drop-in. In `systemctl --user edit fleet-wake@my-project`,
save the following service settings (the default override location is
`~/.config/systemd/user/fleet-wake@my-project.service.d/override.conf`):

```ini
[Service]
EnvironmentFile=%h/.config/orchestrator-fleet/%i.env
```

`%h` is the user's home and `%i` is the selected instance name. Keep the file
operator-owned and populate only intended public fleet settings locally. For an
existing instance, activation happens after remote merge and local filesystem
adoption: the operator updates its selected env file, ensures the drop-in above
exists, then runs:

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user restart fleet-wake@my-project
```

This manual configuration and activation procedure applies to fresh, inactive,
uninstalled or changed service-template cases. Ordinary eligible fleet ticks
require no operator approval. After a separately authorized **code-only merge**
and filesystem adoption, the existing merge-adoption verifier may automatically
use `systemctl --user try-restart` **only** for an already active, registered,
stale fleet-wake unit whose exact project, mapped adopted checkout, MainPID and
process identity have been verified and rechecked before control. It must then
read back a distinct fresh running identity. It never starts an inactive
instance, repairs a failed/mismatched/unverified one or installs/edits env files,
drop-ins or templates; those cases remain `operationally_incomplete` with the
exact adoption remainder for the operator. A fresh already-running process needs
no restart. No operation from a feature worktree is authorized.

Runtime readback after any actual activation must exercise the linked Issue's
fleet regression; a clean-checkout pointer check alone is implementation proof,
not operational verification. The public example contains no machine-specific
values.

Check the service and log:

```bash
systemctl --user status fleet-wake@my-project
tail -f ~/.local/state/orchestrator-fleet/my-project.fleet-wake.log
```

A healthy tick logs `nothing stopped` when there is no newly
actionable pane. A project with no matching coordinator logs
`normal fleet result: no orchestrator pane found` and returns without sending
a Wake. STOPPED/POLLING alarms are per-pane and fire once per state transition.
Changes to another pane do not duplicate an existing alarm. PARKED never
causes an immediate coordinator alarm; a matching producer event sends
a direct re-check Wake to its pane, and an unresolved park receives its
existing Reminder on elapsed 30-minute slots. `suspected_bare_shell`
is the one exception: send no Wake text to the shell and alarm the
coordinator once for that pane's state change. The notifier uses per-(pane,
event) sent marks, not owner proofs or an alarm-set digest. An unreadable
required pane screen skips that sweep tick.

### Unsaved ChatGPT local banners — Issue #2471

On the existing selected-project CDP snapshot, only a complete
`/c/local-chatgpt:<uuid>` path under the exact configured project conversation
prefix is eligible for the **coordinator-only** local banner warning. Query and
fragment are discarded; UUID case is normalized. The once-per-local key includes
the selected project, repository and the **full normalized provisional URL**, not
a reusable CDP target ID. Missing/malformed/foreign local URLs remain read-only
diagnostic evidence. Generating chats do not alarm; a stalled response requires
two consecutive observations. A visible red error/Retry or an unloadable chat
(no composer) may qualify immediately, but the notifier **never presses Retry**,
Stop, or browser-send controls.

**No local banner is delivered to a worker, manager or architect pane.** A
`local-chatgpt:` placeholder cannot use a chat binding, a guessed Task/Issue/PR,
branch, worktree, inherited `ORCA_TERMINAL_HANDLE` or native pane incarnation
to select an owner, nor may it be closed through the Issue-based superseded-chat
heuristic. A local warning explicitly states that its owner, workflow role and
current-turn invocation are **unproven**; the coordinator independently verifies
live Task/Issue/PR and existing Browser-GPT send/no-resend evidence before any
continuation decision. The DOM's `review=true` or `review=false` is not
workflow-role authority. Only **after** execution role and same-chat send
authority are separately established can the existing execution continuation
phrase apply; a separately confirmed PR reviewer can request only its existing
verdict phrase, not code fixes. Unloadable chats use the authorized fresh-chat
recovery instead. A warning never authorizes automatic resend or a new chat.

The local warning is **at most one attempted coordinator notification per
provisional chat**, including across later Retry changes, 30/60-minute ticks,
unrelated STOPPED/POLLING/PARKED/Run-mail events and notifier-store restarts.
Before the first potentially effectful text+Enter, the existing per-project
wake-mark store records `attempted_unverified`. Only successful text+Enter
**and** delayed second Enter change that mark to `sent`; failure, uncertain
delivery or observed handle/incarnation replacement preserves uncertainty and
does not automatically replay. A fresh local warning bypasses the ordinary
30-minute coordinator throttle, but marked local URLs and banner text are
excluded from all later **ordinary** coordinator messages **and signatures**.
Successful mixed alarms persist the signature/time of the ordinary non-local
events, so removing the one-shot section alone never creates another alarm.
New independent events still follow the existing #2463 cadence.

For a local warning the notifier reads the native coordinator census again
before text+Enter and before the four-second-later Enter, checking the selected
handle/project and current incarnation when observable. If the coordinator is
missing, exited or replaced, it aborts further sends; a partially attempted
delivery is not repeated. Native terminal send is **handle-only**, not an atomic
incarnation guard: replacement within the send operation remains possible.
The existing producer terminal envelopes, even `child_start_failed` with a
matching-looking handoff/receipt, are **not** evidence that a particular local
banner belongs to an observed invocation. No terminal-before-first-local-alarm
suppression is promised; neither a profile key nor a local→saved URL binding
exists on this fleet path. A subsequently saved canonical chat is **not** joined
to the provisional URL, and keeps the previously shipped direct binding,
PR/worktree fallback, producer wakes and superseded-saved-chat behavior.


## Coordinator prompt snippet

At session start, check `systemctl --user status fleet-wake@<project>`. On every
fleet alarm, first process orchestration mail, then run the full `fleet-sweep`.
Give every `STOPPED` or `POLLING` pane its next step in the same turn. A question a
unit typed in its own pane is addressed to the coordinator and must be answered.
For `PARKED` panes, independently re-check the named dependency on
Wake or Reminder. Never resume, resend or merge solely because the fleet
notifier reported an event. Treat bare-shell coordinator alarms as
operator investigation, never as permission to type into a shell.

## Stop or uninstall

```bash
systemctl --user disable --now fleet-wake@my-project
rm -f ~/.config/orchestrator-fleet/my-project.env
systemctl --user daemon-reload
```

Keep `~/.config/systemd/user/fleet-wake@.service` while any other project instance
uses it. After the final project instance is removed, delete the shared template and
run `systemctl --user daemon-reload` once more.

Removing one instance does not affect scheduler/runtime state. Ephemeral polling and
last-sent signature files disappear with the user runtime directory and may also be
removed manually after the service is stopped.
