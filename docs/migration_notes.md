## Goal

Port only the safety contracts that stock Composio Agent Orchestrator does not
already provide architecturally. Do not fork or patch AO core.

## Upstream AO capabilities to preserve

AO already provides:

- per-session worktrees;
- PR, CI, and review reactions;
- dashboard/status UX;
- YAML config through `agent-orchestrator.yaml`;
- `agentRules` / `agentRulesFile` prompt injection;
- session metadata and flat-file state;
- plugin slots for runtime, agent, workspace, tracker, SCM, notifier, and
  terminal integrations.

The pack therefore adds contracts around AO instead of replacing AO orchestration.

## Port priority

1. Task declaration contract equivalent to DD-026/DD-027:
   - declared allowlist metadata;
   - denylist validation;
   - baseline hash/state;
   - one amendment per iteration.
2. Runtime scope gate equivalent to DD-024:
   - first line of defense before `git add`/commit;
   - implemented through an agent wrapper, workspace hook, or pre-commit path;
   - not CI-only.
3. PR-level CI scope check:
   - second line of defense for PR diffs;
   - blocks merge when changed files exceed declared scope;
   - does not replace the runtime guard.
4. Self-architect checks:
   - prompt-level check now;
   - optional CI lint later.
5. Chain token ledger:
   - aggregate planner/reviewer/worker/fix-worker/final-review sessions by
     `chain_id`;
   - build on AO per-session cost when available;
   - not a Tracker plugin.

## Correct terminology

- Say "runtime scope gate + PR CI check", not "commit-gate plugin".
- Say "chain token ledger", not "Tracker token plugin".
- Use `agent-orchestrator.yaml`, not `composio.config.ts`.
- Frame this work as migrating safety contracts, not migrating the orchestrator.

## Explicit non-goals

Do not port:

- Windows-only `lib_codex_exec.ps1`, `cmd /c`, stream/BOM fixes from the old
  project;
- `install_into_project.ps1`;
- the `.ai-loop/` layout as a mandatory protocol;
- per-iteration console-tail UX already covered by AO dashboard/reactions.

## Autonomous review loop (`orchestratorRules` + `report-stale`)

Issue #28 ships the canonical autonomous review-loop contract in
`agent-orchestrator.yaml.example` (`orchestratorRules` block and
`reactions.report-stale` backstop) plus worker rules in `prompts/agent_rules.md`.

To adopt on an existing live `agent-orchestrator.yaml`:

1. Open `agent-orchestrator.yaml.example` and copy the full `orchestratorRules`
   literal for your project (under `projects.<id>.orchestratorRules`).
2. Merge the `report-stale` entry under top-level `reactions` (keep your other
   reaction entries; do not duplicate keys).
3. Ensure `agentRulesFile: prompts/agent_rules.md` (or equivalent path) so workers
   receive the review response contract.
4. Restart AO so prompts reload: `ao stop` then `ao start`.

Until restart, the orchestrator and workers keep prior prompt text. The live YAML
is gitignored — diff against the example when upgrading; do not hand-edit only
the worker rules without updating `orchestratorRules`.

## Orchestrator wake listener (webhook + local HTTP)

Issue #39 adds an event-driven wake path so the orchestrator session gets a turn
when AO emits urgent/action notifications, without polling or schedulers.

To adopt on an existing live `agent-orchestrator.yaml`:

1. Merge the `notifiers.webhook` block from `agent-orchestrator.yaml.example`
   (default URL `http://127.0.0.1:17487/ao-wake`).
2. Merge `notificationRouting` so `urgent` and `action` include `webhook` (keep
   your other notifier channels).
3. Set `AO_ORCHESTRATOR_SESSION_ID` to your orchestrator session id (from
   `ao status`) or pass `-OrchestratorSessionId` when starting the listener.
4. In a separate terminal from the AO daemon, start the listener before or with
   `ao start`:
   `pwsh -File scripts/orchestrator-wake-listener.ps1`
5. Verify reachability:
   `Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 127.0.0.1 -Port 17487`
6. Optional dry-run (logs forward decisions without calling `ao send`):
   `pwsh -File scripts/orchestrator-wake-listener.ps1 -DryRun`

Full operator steps, dedup window, and failure detection are in
`docs/orchestrator-wake-runbook.md`. When the listener is stopped, AO and workers
continue normally; only automatic orchestrator wakes stop.

## Orchestrator stuck / probe_failure recovery

When AO observability flags the orchestrator session (e.g. `op-orchestrator`) as
`stuck` or `probe_failure` while workers or review runs still need coordination,
use the manual escalation runbook — do not improvise kills without inspecting
in-flight state first:

1. Read `docs/orchestrator-recovery-runbook.md` (ordered steps: ping → inspect →
   kill orchestrator session → full `ao stop`/`ao start`).
2. Optionally run `pwsh -File scripts/orchestrator-diagnose.ps1` for a read-only
   one-screen snapshot before escalation.

After recovery, the orchestrator re-applies `orchestratorRules` from your live
YAML (see **Autonomous review loop** above). This path does not add automatic
recovery or new AO configuration.
